## Complete Me

Complete Me is an autocomplete node module built for Turing School of Software & Design.

It was used in a later project to add autocomplete functionality.

To see how it works, check out the autocomplete in the search box on this Weatherly app: https://patrickjneel.github.io/weatherly/
